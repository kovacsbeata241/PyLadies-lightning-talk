#**PyLadies Lightning Talk**# - 12th December, 2024

Datavisualisation as we know it is typically 2 dimensional - e.g. charts. In **Dataphisicalisation** the outcome is 3 dimensionsonal!

I decided to **visualize the max temperatures of Budapest as a poncho**.

I followed the following steps:
1. As the poncho pattern I decided to work with consists of two identical rectangles, I gathered the the max temperatures of the city Budapest for two years

2. Decided, I wanted to work with 8 colours, so I devided the max temperatures' range into 8 "bins" allocating a colour to each bin, each day representing the max temperature of Budapest on that day in the bin's colour

3. Did an estamation of how many balls of yarn to buy in each colour, and how heavy the poncho will be

4. Produced a coloured pattern for knitting.
