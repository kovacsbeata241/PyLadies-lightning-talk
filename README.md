A few words about the project:

Datavisualisation as we know it is typically 2 dimensional - e.g. charts. There is another way, when the outcome can be touched in 3 dimension - Dataphisicalisation!

I have chosen the max temperatures of the city Budapest for two years, devided the range into 8 "bins", allocated a colour to each bin. Each day of the two years represent the max temperature of Budapest on that day in the bin's colour. Each year provides a rectangle, the two sewn together form a poncho.

The code also includes an estimation how many balls of yarn to buy in each colour, and how heavy the poncho will be.

It also produces a coloured pattern for knitting. :-)
